***Project+ Snake Tech Post***

# *Unique properties / moves (by Iris Flower)*

### **Crawl**

Snake is able to crawl which lets him move around with a low profile hurtbox, he also has a knife attack if you press attack while crawling forward though it's not very useful.

### **Grab walking & D-Throw**

While grabbing an opponent he can slowly move around with D-pad left and right (requires side taunt to be mapped to D-pad sides). His other unique grab property is his down throw, which forces an opponent onto the ground in a missed tech state.

### **Up-Smash (Mortar)**

He spawns a mortar cannon which shoots a bomb upwards and slowly falls down, blowing up once it either hits an opponent or a surface. The more you charge the smash the farther the bomb gets shot, in addition you can hold left or right to alter the trajectory of the projectile. Finally the cannon has a hitbox that hits grounded opponents as it's placed on the ground, which makes it very useful for his DACUS. Finally he is immune to the bomb and its explosion.

### **D-Smash (Mine) & F-Smash**

He digs a hole in the ground and places a mine which arms itself shortly after, the more you charge the attack the more damage the mine will do. The mine blows up if anything comes into contact with it, including projectiles or rolls etc. If 25 seconds have passed since arming it or Snake dies it will blow up on its own.

Forward smash he slashes twice with a knife but you can activate a third slash by pressing attack a second time.

### 

### **Neutral B (Grenade)**

He takes out a grenade which will blow up after a bit, holding special will have him continue to hold the grenade in his hand and letting go will have him throw it. He can throw the grenade in 4 different ways: holding neutral or back on the stick has him throw in a normal arc, holding forward has him toss quickly in a straight line, holding down has him lightly toss it onto the ground, and holding up has him toss it upwards underhand. He can also shield while holding the grenade to drop it on the ground, where you can then also pick it up and throw it like a normal item.

The grenades don’t explode when hitting an opponent, instead they bounce off an opponent dealing a bit of damage, blowing up once the timer is up. They can however be blown up early by an opponent’s attack while Snake cannot blow them up with his own attacks, Snake can however get hit by the explosion of the grenade. 

### 

### **Side B (Tranq)**

He shoots a tranquilizer projectile which travels a medium horizontal distance, any grounded opponent who gets hit by it falls asleep. It does only 1% and does not put people to sleep in the air, as well as dealing virtually no knockback. The gun starts with 3 bullets in it, after the 3rd bullet is fired doing Side B again will make him do a long reload animation, after the reload is done he’ll have 3 bullets in the gun again. You can reload anytime you want by pressing Side B \+ shield. 

### **Down B (C4)**

He places a C4 on the ground which he can then blow up at any time by pressing Down B again, or you can do a fakeout by holding down the button. If used in the air he’ll drop it and the C4 will continue to fall until it lands and sticks to the ground. If used while close enough to an opponent they’ll get “sticky” where the C4 is placed directly onto the character, and unlike vanilla Brawl it can’t be stuck back to someone else by making contact with them. You can also stick someone through their shield, making C4 act almost like a pseudo-command grab. C4 will remain stuck onto either a character or the ground permanently until it's blown up or if Snake dies, in which it’ll just disappear. 

### **Up B (Cypher)**

Snake’s Up B has him deploy a cypher and slowly ascend upwards until he eventually lets go of it and falls down, he can only grab the ledge after releasing the cypher and not during the ascent. He can prematurely release the cypher starting on frame 12, either by pressing down to just let go of it or by using an attack, upon releasing the cypher it gains a hitbox and continues to float upwards towards the blastzone. 

The cypher itself has a hurtbox which can help protect him by taking blows from above, though his body is fully vulnerable to attacks during the entire move. When he releases the cypher he can continue to perform moves except for another Up-B, which he only gets back after either getting hit or touching the ground/ledge, which is why Snake players will often blow themselves up with C-4 to continuously recover offstage. Finally his body also spews electricity during his initial ascent which hits opponents and helps further protect him / can combo into things.

# ***Advanced Tech** (all of below [originally](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C9_i2bDJ-o3ukzNyTg5pRoZnRsd6xD92d0JyjhoFACk/edit?usp=sharing) by JohnLee\_Erg)*

### [**Jump Cancel Up Toss**](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/Jump_Cancel_Up_Toss.mp4)

Something long known to Snake mains but baffling to outsiders like me and Eon when we discovered it is the fact that Snake can jump cancel, specifically, his upward grenade throw. This can be used to very quickly switch from neutral-b throwing to catching and using the grenade as an item, and incorporated as all sorts of fancy movement. My sole contribution to this segment is noting that it can be done [from ledge](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/Jump_Cancel_Up_Toss_from_ledge.mp4), in addition to the million other tricksies Snake can do from that position, which will be covered further on.

### [**CHAI As Plat Movement And Pressure**](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/CHAI.mp4)

**C**ypher **H**op **A**erial **I**nterrupt is performed by doing Snake’s up air precisely as you rise through a platform ([which is useful for movement on its own](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/Uair_Aerial_Interrupt.mp4)) out of up b. The result is a hitbox that cancels into grounded actionability very quickly, allowing for terrifying pressure options and combo mixups. 

### [**CHAI From Ledge(Ledgedash)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djh2MF6sU5s&ab_channel=Yata%21) **| [Mirror](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/CHAI_from_Ledge.mp4)**

You can also do CHAI from ledge, for a hearty 10 GALINT. Snake can ledgedash regularly as well just by airdodging, which might be easier, but it only gives you a max of [5 GALINT](https://gfycat.com/agedmediumeider).

### [**Up-smash Sticking On Plats**](%20https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/Perfect_Ledgedash_5_GALINT.mp4)

Using Very Precise positioning, Snake can get his up-smash projectile stuck on the edges of plats. Unfortunately this also requires the platform itself to be in very specific positioning, so it’s probably not possible on any tourney legal stage other than on moving platforms, making it inherently inconsistent. 

### [**Nair Plat Lands**](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/Nair_Plat_Cancel.mp4)

Similar to, but much less effective than his Uair Aerial Interrupts, Snake can plat cancel his Nair as he double jumps through a platform, landing quickly after the first hit of nair. This is…  not amazingly useful but its pretty swag, it [links into grab at higher percents](%20https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/Nair_Plat_Cancel_Linking_into_Grab.mp4), and it’s not very difficult. Give it a whirl, and add some extra flair into your Snake platform techchases. 

### [**C4 Recovery**](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/SDI_Up_Vs._No_SDI_low__C4_Recovery.mp4)

This is like, the bread and butter of Snake techskill. Snake can blow himself up with his down b after having already used up b in order to both gain height (once you’re high enough percent) and also regain the use of your up b. As you get higher percent, you’ll be able to mix up between going high above the stage or [teching the wall](%20https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/C4_Recovery_DI_Mixup.mp4)/ceiling and trying to go for ledge. Good use of these options, and the grenade variants described further on, can make it so that Snake can make it back from pretty much anywhere. Note that of course if you have someone stickied, you won't be able to use this for recovery until that mine is detonated, so be sure to keep track.

### [**Floor bounce Grenade**](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/Grenade_Bounce.mp4)

Snakes grenade bounces off of the ground, which can be used to place grenades at specific heights above you, usually more useful heights than whipping it upwards gets you. You can vary the height it ends up at by [varying the height you throw it from](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/Grenade_Bounce_2.mp4).

### [**Wall Bounce Grenades As Recovery**](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/Wall_Bounce_AGT.mp4)

Snake’s grenade *also* bounces off of walls, which means you can recover by throwing a grenade at the wall and AGTing it up on the rebound, or just blowing it up. This can theoretically be done [several times in a row](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/AGT_Wall_Climb.mp4), until it explodes at least.

### [**Wall Bounce Grenades As Edgeguard**](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/Offensive_Wall_Bounce_Nades.mp4)

Of course, there’s no rule saying you can only use wall bang grenades for recovery. Chucking them at various on sloped walls will send them ricocheting at a variety of angles, great for stylish edgeguards that cover unexpected angles. You can even get some good angles right [from ledge](https://gfycat.com/anguishedembarrassedafricanpiedkingfisher).

### [**Despawning Grenades As Recovery**](%20https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/Grenade_Despawn_Recovery.mp4)

If you’re near the side blast zone as Snake recovering, it might be worthwhile to AGT the grenade off screen, which despawns it, allowing you to more quickly throw another. This is a very niche option but it’s useful to understand the mechanic in case you encounter it in a match. [Kirby](https://gfycat.com/sophisticatedfluidhammerheadshark) can actually make even better use of it.

### [**Full Drift Down Toss AGT**](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/Down_Throw_Grenade_AGT.pm4.mp4)

Another way to make use of grenades while recovering is catching a grenade that you’ve bowled forward. If you have full drift in the direction you’re bowling the grenade you can double jump and agt it. This can give you some extra height and versatility in your recovery without having to blow yourself up at all.

### [**IGT (AGT OOS)**](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/IGT.mp4)

A simple but useful term for Snake players, IGT, **I**nstant **G**lide **T**oss just refers to aerial glide tossing a grenade directly out of shield, as it falls. Since shielding makes Snake drop the grenade, this (in addition to shield dropping) is probably the fastest way to transition between neutral b throwing and regular item throwing.

### [**Nade Pull Force Drops Held Item**](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/Banana_Stuff.mp4)

Pulling a grenade with neutral b forces Snake to immediately drop any other he might be holding. This is super useful for any item matchup, as it can let Snake very quickly set up a situation where he has posession of both characters' items at once. [Here](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/Nade_Drop_Banana_Tech_Coverage.mp4)’s another example that uses the banana and grenade for covering all tech options. The possibilities are endless\!

### [**CC Tanking Grenade**](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/CC_Nade_2.mp4)

Not only is blowing yourself up key for recovery as Snake, it can be useful in combos as well\! At low percents, you can CC or asdi down a grenade explosion and be at a significant frame advantage to your opponent, on hit or on block. This can be pretty [potent](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/CC_Nade.mp4) for cool Snake combos, but can also be [used against him](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/CC_Nade_3.mp4) as any character, if you’re savvy enough of the percents you can CC grenade at\!

### [**KB Stacking Shenanigans**](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/Knockback_Stacking.mp4)

Being a character with a ton of projectiles and explosives he can be actionable during, Snake has a ton of potential for crazy knockback stacking combos. The header clip is a pretty extreme example to show the high end of what's possible as a true combo with knockback stacking, if you’re aware of its effects you can make use of it [in a match](https://youtu.be/UQd3u5VNnz8?t=365) as well. 

### [**Aerials with An Item**](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/Aerial_With_Item.mp4)

If Snake does an aerial side b, or a down b plant (but not a down b detonation), he can IASA into aerials without throwing an item. This is a special property that certain special moves allow, and it can be great for keeping your options varied while holding on to an item. Of course this is more useful with something like banana than grenade, but you still technically have time to get an aerial out before the grenade blows you up. Maybe this could be combined with Take Grenade Tactics for a truly technical combo?

### [**Tranq Coverage**](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/Tranq_Tech_Trapping.mp4)

Apparently tranq can hit every tech option of back throw if you’re positioned correctly on the stage. Wow\!

### [**Drift On Aerials**](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/Drift_On_Dair_Nair_and_Bair.mp4)

Like many characters, Snake can drift back on to a platform after sliding off and be able to land again with certain aerials, provided they connect. This works with Snake’s bair, nair, and dair. It’s easiest (read: still quite hard) to get out of rolling to ledge, but you can also set it up slyly by moonwalking. These are a very unexplored area in P+ combos considering how many characters can do this, so there could be a lot of potential in here if you were willing to get real good at these\! (I do them a bunch with Mario but that’s because his dash attack sets them up super easy, and even then I haven’t implemented them for [dair or bair](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/Drift_On_Dair_and_Bair.mp4) or [nair](https://gfycat.com/spottedoblongbufflehead) yet, [only uair](https://youtu.be/UQd3u5VNnz8?t=123). The possibilities in this game never end\!\!)

# ***Footstool Setups***

* [Dair Footstool Infinite](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/Dair_Footstool.mp4)  
  * Dair footstool loops with Snake are in fact a terrifying reality. All the Snake player has to do is avoid landing the final hit of dair and chase the opponent’s sdi. It is possible to sdi out to the side, but it can be pretty difficult for the thicker characters to escape without taking a lot of percent first.   
* [Nair Footstool](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/Nair_Footstool.mp4)  
  * Nair has some nice autolink dragdown type beat properties that make it another viable setup for footstools.  
* [Dthrow Footstool](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/Dthrow_Footstool.mp4)  (and how to get out of it)  
  * A common tactic to get your opponent below ledge as Snake. Makes use of the fact that Snake can uniquely walk around while grabbing someone using left and right on the d-pad.   
  * It's not real, you can get out by fastfalling or doing any aerial or up b or pretty much anything.  
      
* [Cypher Footstool](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/On_Stage_Cypher_Footstool.mp4)  
  * Another fancy option to lead into footstool is out of cypher. You can cancel cypher without doing an aerial by flicking the stick down, and you can footstool immediately out of it. This is particularly useful [offstage](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/Offstage_Cypher_Footstool.mp4), where, having used your up b, footstooling someone might be your only way to recover\!  
    

# [***Taunt Hitboxes***](https://gfycat.com/dearestwindingasianporcupine)

* Snake’s Down Taunt has him hiding in a box. This box state has a surprising amount of functionality. For one, you can walk left and right with the Dpad, like when grabbing someone. If you wait for a while, or press anything else, Snake will toss the box over his shoulder, which has a weak hitbox, kinda viable for edgeguarding. You can also [cancel it by walking off ledge](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/Box_Taunt_Fall_to_Ledge.mp4), which can be a good mixup with the hitbox.   
* Snakes Up Taunt has him smoking a cigarette, which deals 1% to Snake, but has a hitbox that damages opponents when he flicks it away after he takes a drag. BUT it’s also jump cancellable after the drag but before the throw, which keeps the cig in Snake’s mouth, and lets you flick it immediately the next time you press u-taunt. This stored cig flick is actually a pretty useful edgeguard tool.   
* Not incredibly useful info, but you *could* use either of these taunts [on mines](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/Taunt_Hitboxes_Hitting_Mines.mp4) to detonate them remotely, with style. 

# ***Useful Information***

* [Grenade Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sjuYAxEwHI) | [Mirror](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/How_Snakes_Grenades_Work_in_Project_M.mp4)  
* [Wall sticks](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/Wall_Mines.mp4)  
  * Another thing that can get in the way of Snake c4 recoveries is accidentally sticking to the wall. But on the other hand, you could use this to cover below the ledge remotely.   
* You probably know that Snake needs to reload his tranquilizer gun (side b) after 3 shots, but did you know you can reload early if you hold shield while doing side b?  
  * You also might not know that tranq is actually reloaded at the moment in the reload animation that the clip enters the tranq gun, so if you’re hit out of it after that point the gun still gets reloaded. Kojima-esque attention to detail\!

# ***Fun Facts***

* If you uthrow or fthrow and pull a grenade before landing, Kirby will just... [levitate.](https://twitter.com/Eon_TAS/status/1439704826997362689?t=4wynE_9JWTIBehyi-Tu2Fg&s=19)  
* If you sticky Nana and then kill Popo, Nana will respawn with the sticky still attached. In a similar vein, if you sticky a Sheik or Zelda and they transform, the sticky will fall to the ground.  
* *“funny thing coz of restrictions in modding, tranq alternates between a grounded hit and an aerial hit every frame coz you cant have two different hitboxes on the move without a lot of module edit work” \-eon*  
* If Snake is hit out of his crawl tilt, he will [keep the knife](https://woodleybrew.github.io/PPlus-Knowledge-Database/Characters/Snake/Snake%20Media/Keeping_the_Knife.mp4) in his hand until he goes into a standing state or crawl tilts again. Doesn’t do anything, but it looks cool.  
* If someone catches a grenade before Snake finishes his throw animation, the opponent will be forced to drop the grenade once the animation ends. [Pretty weird\!](https://gfycat.com/bogusveneratedankole)

# **Conclusion**

Thanks to everyone who helped out from both the labbing discord and the Snake discord for this\! Particular shoutouts for contribution go to Eon, Cody, ferarri77, FlashingFire, luxingo, Chevy, Ilikepizza107, DrinkingFood, Big Large, and probably others\!  
Our next session will be on **Sonic,** as according to the 3.6 css order. This will run from now until around **November 1st,** although if you’ve been keeping track, you’ll know it might well take longer than that; Sonic is a pretty technical character, we’ll need help so hop in the labbing [discord](https://discord.gg/XDMm5Kp) with us and lend a hand\! 

Sonic is also the *Second Last Character AT ALL.* After him it’s Knuckles, and then thats it\! There’ll be a discussion here and in the Labbing discord as to what to do with these posts once they’re all done. Reddit no longer seems to be the hub of PM player activity that it once was when I started these posts, and none of the places we’ve moved to are conducive to centralised information. My current best idea is to just add them all to the smash wiki, but I don’t know how easy that will be or how smash wiki mods feel about adding PM stuff. There’s also been talk of converting these into a video series as well, though I don’t think I personally could commit much time to that. If you have any suggestions, let me know in the comments\!

And as always, feel free to ask any questions below, or let me know about any tech we've missed.  
Until Next Time,   
*“Colonel, we’re done here.”*
